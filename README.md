# Server-Client-Interaction
This is a simple project which creates a server-client interaction environment through socket programming in python. 
The marks.csv file is read line by line. The Server.py file prints a line from the file. If the client who runs the 
Client.py file presses the ENTER key, the same line that the server printed out will be printed on the client's side.
The connection is terminated when there are no more lines to be read.
